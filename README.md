# Pocillopora-spp-larvae-competency

Coral spawning is a phenomenon known worldwide, affecting many coral species. However, certain aspects of this reproduction are not well understood, particularly the recruitment phase in species such as *Pocillopora* spp. Many studies have been conducted on *Pocillopora acuta*, but very few have been done on *P. meandrina*, *P. verrucosa*, *P. tuahineensis*, *P. grandis* and *P. cf. effusa*. Crucial for reef development, genetic mixing, habitat creation, and increasing reef complexity, the pre-competency and competency phases must be studied to complete the reproductive cycle of *Pocillopora* spp. In French Polynesia, **Harnay et al. 2024** documented the reproduction of *P. meandrina*, *P. verrucosa*, *P. tuahineensis*, and *P. cf. effusa* for the first time, providing more insights and possibilities for increasing research on the settlement phases.

In this context, this study aims to define a period of pre-competency and competency based on the protocol of **Randal et al. 2024** for *P. meandrina*, *P. verrucosa*, *P. tuahineensis*, *P. cf. effusa* and *P. grandis* in French Polynesia on the island of Mo'orea. 

This step of understanding will help us fill in missing parts of the reproductive cycle and also provide more knowledge about recruitment in cryptic species dominant on many coral reefs worldwide, such as on the island of Mo'orea.

### Design experimental 
The diagram below is a generalized plan of the experimental design. The full experimental plan/protocol is available in the **Metadata** section.

**Fig 2:**  **A**: General plan for the distribution of the 5 tested elements as recruitment substrates. Three types of CCA (crustose coralline algae) were selected based on the study by **Vizon et al. 2024**. A total of 6 replicates per condition were carried out. Within each well, 10 *Pocillopora* larvae were placed. All substrates and larvae were replaced every 24 hours. **B**: 1) Collection of larvae from the lagoon 2) Maintenance of larvae in an aquarium (by spawning date and species; larvae from different colonies are fertilized and mixed in the aquariums) maintained in an open system 3) Counting of larvae under a microscope using blue light (to enhance fluorescent proteins and detect the larvae) 4) Placement of larvae according to their conditions. Steps 2 to 4 will be performed daily until the settlement phase is observed.
